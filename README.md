to detect brain tumours 

 Brain Tumour Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting **brain tumours from MRI scans** using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
It classifies MRI images into four categories:

- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumour

The goal of this project is to assist medical professionals by providing an automated, fast, and reliable tumour classification system.
